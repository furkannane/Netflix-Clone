# Video-Streaming-React-Native-App

This React Native app is a video streaming app inspired by Netflix that allows users to search for movies, to view details of movies and actors,
to watch the video attached to the movie (for obvious copyright reasons not the movie itself), to add movies and actors to their respective favourite lists. 
It fetches data from the Django backend app. Database contains some movies and actors. All data that the app needs is supplied by the backend.
